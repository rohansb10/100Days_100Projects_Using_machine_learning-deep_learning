# Uber_Data_Analysis_with_Machine_Learning

This project focuses on analyzing Uber's rideshare data using various machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to uncover insights and patterns that can help understand customer behavior, identify potential areas for service improvement, and optimize operational efficiency.

## Key Features:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, formatting, and preparing Uber's rideshare data for analysis, including handling missing values, removing outliers, and transforming variables as needed.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducting comprehensive EDA to gain an understanding of the data, visualize trends, and identify potential correlations and patterns.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Designing and creating new features from the existing data that may better capture relevant information for predictive modeling.

4. **Machine Learning Modeling**: Implementing and evaluating various machine learning algorithms, such as regression, classification, clustering, and time series forecasting, to address specific business problems or predict future demand.

5. **Model Evaluation and Interpretation**: Assessing the performance of trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics and techniques, and interpreting the model results to derive actionable insights.

## Technologies Used:

- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Machine Learning Libraries (Scikit-learn)
